# 🌐 Windsurf Code Reuse & Export Guide

This guide provides a structured prompt for **Windsurf** to analyze existing projects and determine which code modules, utilities, or design patterns can be **reused or adapted** for the **Windsurf Book Webapp**. The objective is to leverage established, reliable components to ensure efficiency, maintainability, and consistency across projects.

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Project:** Windsurf Book Webapp — Bootstrap & Automation Guide  
**Goal:** Create a **multilingual, mobile-first, static web application** that renders Markdown chapters as an interactive online book.  
**Core Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, optional Redis (for background queues), and optional FastAPI (for AI-driven translation).  

**Project Structure:**
- `dev/templates/` → flat collection of reusable template files (HTML, JS, Python, JSON, shell, service units). Downstream projects may reorganize as needed.  
- `docs/export/` → Markdown summaries documenting each reusable component.  
- `docs/bootstrap/` → prompt guides (this file and related workflows).

## 🧩 Essential Code Components

1. **Markdown Renderer** — lightweight parser with security-minded sanitization.  
2. **Routing System** — hash-based navigation supporting chapters and locales.  
3. **Global State Store** — unified state manager for locale, version, and chapter.  
4. **Table of Contents UI** — responsive drawer for mobile, sidebar for desktop.  
5. **AI Translation Connector** — FastAPI interface linking to the Ollama API.  
6. **Redis Queue Utility** — asynchronous background processing and caching.  
7. **Build Scripts** — Markdown linting, changelog updates, and version stamping.  
8. **Deployment Utilities** — static build automation and Nginx configuration templates.

## 🧠 Task for Windsurf

> Review all **previous Windsurf projects** and identify which modules, functions, or classes can be repurposed for this application. For each candidate, create a detailed Markdown file under `docs/export/` describing:
>
> 1. The **original project name** and **file path**.  
> 2. A concise **summary** of its functionality.  
> 3. How it can be **integrated or adapted** here.  
> 4. Any **dependencies, requirements, or compatibility notes**.

This ensures transparent tracking of code provenance and promotes modular reuse across Windsurf’s ecosystem.

## 📂 File Reference Structure

All Markdown documentation generated by Windsurf should follow this structure and reference the templates under `dev/templates/`:
```
docs/export/
  ├─ markdown_renderer.md
  ├─ router_reuse.md
  ├─ toc_component.md
  ├─ store_logic.md
  ├─ translation_api.md
  ├─ redis_queue.md
  ├─ build_automation.md
  └─ deployment_utilities.md
```

Each Markdown file should include:
- **Header:** original filename and source project.  
- **Template reference:** note the filename inside `dev/templates/` and how to relocate it.  
- **Adaptation notes:** practical steps for integration with the Book Webapp and reminders that teams may rearrange files.

## 📘 Why Export & Reuse

This documentation process ensures that tried-and-tested logic from past Windsurf projects remains accessible and functional. It encourages:
- **Consistency** across projects.  
- **Faster development** by reusing proven components.  
- **Sustainability** through centralized documentation of reusable logic.

---

## ✅ Next Step for Windsurf

After identifying reusable components, Windsurf should automatically:
1. Create Markdown summaries in `docs/export/` for each reusable module.  
2. Cross-link each summary to its new integration within the Book Webapp.  
3. Generate a final index file summarizing all reused components, referencing the corresponding entries in `dev/templates/` and noting their integration points.
